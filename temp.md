❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely result in an error when the
function is executed, as JavaScript will try to access variables that don't exist in the current context.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, which means that the values of `a` and `b` are not being passed into the
function.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b){ return a+b; }
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are used to calculate the sum.
* ✔ The variables `a` and `b` are now defined as parameters of the function, which means that they are accessible within
the function's scope.
* ✔ This approach makes the function more flexible and reusable, as it can be used to calculate the sum of any two
numbers.
